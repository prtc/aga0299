# General Lecture Preparation Workflow

## Project Purpose

This project supports Paula's lecture development across all astrophysics courses and topics at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo. The workflow emphasizes efficiency, reproducibility, and alignment with modern academic publishing practices.

## Core Workflow Philosophy

### Human-AI Collaboration Model
- **Conceptual discussions** happen in Claude's chat interface for iterative idea development
- **Content creation** uses file system tools or Claude Code for direct Quarto document generation
- **Iterative refinement** through review cycles and targeted edits
- **Version control ready** outputs for long-term maintenance

### Technical Foundation
- **Quarto documents** (.qmd) as the primary format for all lecture content
- **Multiple output formats**: RevealJS for presentations, HTML for course pages, PDF when needed
- **Reproducible workflow** with version control integration
- **Code integration capability** for live demonstrations when appropriate

## Typical Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Discussion Phase
- **Topic exploration** and learning objective clarification
- **Audience assessment** (undergraduate/graduate level, background assumptions)
- **Structure planning** (lecture length, key concepts, examples needed)
- **Resource identification** (textbooks, papers, datasets, visualizations)

### 2. Content Development Phase
- **Outline creation** with major sections and transitions
- **Content writing** directly to .qmd files using file system tools
- **Code example integration** when demonstrations are needed
- **Visual element planning** (figures, animations, interactive content)

### 3. Formatting and Style Phase
- **Quarto structure optimization** (YAML headers, chunk options, cross-references)
- **RevealJS customization** (themes, transitions, slide breaks)
- **Accessibility considerations** (alt text, color contrast, clear headings)
- **Mobile-friendly formatting** for student reference

### 4. Review and Iteration Phase
- **Content review** for accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness
- **Technical testing** (rendering, code execution, link validation)
- **Refinement cycles** based on feedback and testing
- **Final polishing** and backup creation

## Technical Specifications

### Quarto Configuration Preferences
- **Output formats**: RevealJS for presentations, HTML for reference
- **Code integration**: R chunks when calculations/visualizations needed
- **Citation management**: BibTeX integration for academic references
- **Cross-referencing**: Figures, tables, equations when applicable

### RevealJS Styling
- **Professional academic themes** appropriate for university setting
- **Readable fonts** for both projection and personal viewing
- **Consistent color schemes** aligned with course branding
- **Progressive disclosure** for complex concepts

## Content Development Principles

### Pedagogical Approach
- **Clear learning objectives** stated upfront
- **Conceptual scaffolding** from familiar to novel ideas
- **Multiple representations** (verbal, visual, mathematical, computational)
- **Active learning elements** when possible in presentation format

### Academic Standards
- **Accurate attribution** for all sources and references
- **Current research integration** when relevant to course level
- **Balanced perspectives** on controversial or evolving topics
- **Intellectual honesty** about limitations and uncertainties

### Practical Considerations
- **Time-appropriate content** for standard lecture slots
- **Technology assumptions** realistic for classroom setup
- **Backup plans** for technical difficulties
- **Student accessibility** in content and format

## Quality Assurance

### Content Validation
- **Factual accuracy** verification for all claims and examples
- **Mathematical correctness** for equations and calculations
- **Code functionality** testing for all embedded examples
- **Reference verification** for citations and external links

### Technical Testing
- **Multi-platform rendering** (Windows, Mac, Linux compatibility)
- **Browser compatibility** for HTML outputs
- **Mobile responsiveness** for student access
- **Performance optimization** for large files or complex content

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Claude's Role
- **Content expertise** drawing from scientific knowledge base
- **Technical implementation** of Quarto/RevealJS features
- **Pedagogical suggestions** based on educational best practices
- **Quality assurance** through systematic review processes

### Paula's Role
- **Subject matter authority** and final content decisions
- **Pedagogical context** specific to course and student needs
- **Technical preferences** and institutional requirements
- **Quality control** and approval for all outputs

### Iterative Process
- **Open dialogue** about content challenges and solutions
- **Flexible adaptation** to changing requirements or insights
- **Continuous improvement** based on teaching experience
- **Knowledge preservation** for future course iterations

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Gains
- **Reduced preparation time** through systematic workflow
- **Reusable components** across multiple courses
