## Sample Content

This slide shows how your lecture content would look.

:::{.incremental}
- **Astronomical data** comes in many forms
- **Digital images** require careful handling  
- **FITS format** is the standard
- **DS9** provides visualization tools
:::

---

## Code Example

```{.python}
# Example pixel coordinate
# Bottom-left pixel: (1,1) in FITS convention
reduced_image = (raw_image - bias - dark) / flat_field
```

:::{.callout-note}
**PDF Reference**: Section 2.1, p. 5-6

## Callout Examples

:::{.callout-important}
Digital data analysis skills are now **essential** for modern astronomers
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
**Signal-to-noise ratio** improves as √(exposure time × telescope area)
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
These steps are **essential** - raw astronomical images are not science-ready!

## Two-Column Layout

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
**Observational Data:**
- Images: 2D brightness arrays
- Spectra: 1D wavelength vs. intensity
- Data cubes: 3D datasets
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
**Simulation Data:**
- N-body: Particle-based
- Grid-based: Cell properties
- Hybrid approaches
